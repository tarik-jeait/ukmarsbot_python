# UKMARSbot running python on maker nano RP2040 board using MicroPython with 4 wall sensors board
# 5V cpu board socket pin removed and 5v and 3.3v lines connected on back of the sensor connector
# R7 10K resistor removed to stop battery voltage feed to CPU
# In Thonny on windows PC  - From Run, Select Interpreter then MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)
# 30:1 gear motors with magnetic encoders from pi hut 18cm = about 4000 pulses on sum of 4 encoders
#
# uses 2 LEDs on sensor board plus the Nano boardpin 18 LED to select programs no 0 to 7
# press PCB switch to advance the program number from 0 through to 7
# - program number is dislayed as 3 bits of binary
# - prog 1 = maze solver, 2 = maze solver with debug on, 3 = phototest,  
# - prog 4 = encodertest, 5 = switchtest, 6 = motortest
# When the PCB tactile button is pressed the switchvalue goes from 0 to 1
#
# To run mazesolver - switch on power, press PCB button once , - or 2 times to put debug on (red LED lit)
# press GP20 button on Nano board to select program being indicated,
# make sure mouse is set in centre of cstart cell press PCB button to store side wall calibration data,
# press GP20 button to start run. Mouse will move back to align with rear wall of start cell, then go ahead.
# Robot pauses for 2 seconds at the end of each move if in debug mode

# maze solver routines needed:
# calcroute - build a list of cells to get from 1st cell to 2nd cell using flood info
# calibrate - get mouse aligned centrally between the walls
# detectwalls - read sensors and set flags to say which walls seen if any
# floodmaze - flood maze from 1st cell number to 2nd cell number
# moveahead - go specified distance forward and at specified end speed whilst following walls if present
# runroute - run a sequence of cells at a given speed
# setaheadwall - set flag for wall seen ahead when at centre of cell
# setsidewalls  set flags for the side walls seen as we go into that cell
# triggerstart - detect pulse in front of mouse o start it once against back wall
# turnleft - smooth turn left from middle of cell to middle of cell
# turnright - smooth turn right from middle of cell to middle of cell
# turnaround  - stop and then spin 180 degrees, and if present back up to rear wall after spin
# wherenext - decide when in cell centre whether to continue ahead or turn
